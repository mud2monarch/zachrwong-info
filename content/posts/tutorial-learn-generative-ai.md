We are in a golden age of learning enabled by generative AI. Yet I am constantly stunned by how few people are using generative AI to learn new things. In the below video, I explain how to use GPT-4 as a *teacher*.

By teaching myself what a tensor is, what the role of math is in modern machine learning, and how to create a class in Python, I hope to show you how you can use generative AI to learn anything in the world. I explain my prompts, what I’m thinking about, how to control hallucinations, and other small tips for how to use generative AI to your advantage.

I strongly believe everyone who is intellectually curious would greatly benefit from understanding how to use generative AI, and I hope this video helps some of you do that.
