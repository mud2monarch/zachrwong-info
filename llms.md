# LLM Instructions for this project

### Context on what I'm doing
I currently have a personal website that uses Wordpress and I think it's hosted on... bluehost? I want to redo my personal website with a few goals in mind: (1) loads faster, less bloat, less slop -- I use 2% of the features of wordpress and it is very unperformant (takes 4-5s to render), (2) fully controlled and written by myself -- I like learning to program, I have some htML/css experience and it's really simple anyways, and I want to be able to manipulate my own website, (3) self-host my website -- my website has just a few MBs of content and maybe 5 visitors per day on a good day. i think it'd be cool to self-host my website.

I need two things: (1) homepage with an About section, contact section, etc. (2) a blog. I might need 'project' pages where i can group things thematically, e.g., something to highlight my repos, whatever. My plan is to use Hugo for my website then write my homepage in static html/css.

I know a bit of HTML and CSS from high school (literally ten years ago) but haven't used it much since. as you know from memory, I am relatively advanced in SQL, maybe intermediate- in Python and hopefully starting to get to the flat part of the learning curve on Rust (if it's logarithmic time-learning). I like thinking in Rust terms.

I do not know that much Go, JS, or web development, so I may need a bit more hand holding. assume I have mid-college CS experience but no language-specific experience in Go, JS, TS, etc.
