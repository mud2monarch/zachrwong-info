      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting areas of blockchain innovation is the use of “TEEs” to introduce &lt;em&gt;verifiability&lt;/em&gt; in important systems. A “TEE” is a special kind of computer that has an embedded private key. The computer can use the private key to make verifiable attestations about its behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As discussed prior in this blog (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://paragraph.com/@mud2monarch/disaggregating-decentralization&#34;&gt;Gyges Lydias: Disaggregating Decentralization&lt;/a&gt;), verifiability is one of the key goods provided by decentralization. In this case, even though a TEE may be run by a single party, it still provides valuable user protections worth pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
